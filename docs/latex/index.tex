\hypertarget{index_Objective}{}\section{Objective}\label{index_Objective}
The purpose of this library is to provide a easy to use framework for various data structures and also to get some practise in writing code for different data structures and using different synchronization primitives \hypertarget{index_Status}{}\section{Status}\label{index_Status}
Currently there is a long way to go for the code, the basic framework is in place and athough the progress has been slow due to real life commitments, changes are being made intermittently.
