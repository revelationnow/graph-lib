How is the graph library provided to users?
How is a user expected to use the library?
  -> 1. User has a real world graph in mind, like a graph of airports connected by the number of flights each one has to another and user wants to represent that
  -> 2. User has wants to generate a random graph
  -> 3. Graphs of facebook friends
What needs to be optimized for best user experience?
